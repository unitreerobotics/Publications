### XDog

XDog (2013~2016), as far as we know, should be the first four-legged robot driven by disc-type out-rotor brushless motor (8108 Motor) in the world. Check [XDog videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ZPBL1zsLCg).  

In the early 2014, the knee joint of XDog was tested driven by synchronous belt. Check [belt-driven video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QaANF4JWQs).
But it was changed to link transmission afterwards.   

8108 outrunner brushless motor have many manufacturers.
